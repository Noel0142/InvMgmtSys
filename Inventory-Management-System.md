## Overview
Utilizing Zapier to automate email notifications and Notion to create an inventory management system. The intention was to make sure that, in the event that a stock amount drops to zero, an automated email informing the administrator to replenish supplies would be issued.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Notion**: For creating and managing the inventory database.
- **Zapier**: For automating the workflow and sending email notifications.
- **Gmail**: For sending emails (can be replaced with any email service).
- **VS Code**: For documentation.

## Setting Up Notion Database
   ### 1. Set up a Notion database with the following fields:
   - **Item Description**: Name of the inventory item.
   - **Stock Capacity**: Number of items in stock.
   - **Stock Used**:Quantity of stock items that have been consumed or utilized.
   - **Current Stock**:Quantity of stock items currently available in inventory.
   - **Reorder Level**:Minimum quantity of stock at which new items should be ordered to maintain inventory levels.
   - **Stock Alert**: Formulas to generate a stock alert message.
   - **Unit Type**:The standard measurement or classification for a particular item or product.
   - **Employee Remarks**:Comments or notes made by employees regarding a specific issue, task, or observation.

   ### 2. Formula for Stock Alert
   ```notion
    if(prop("Current Stock") == 0, 
    "ðŸš¨ Stock quantity is zero. Immediate restock required.", 
    if(prop("Current Stock") <= prop("Reorder Level"), 
        "ðŸ”´ Low Stock. Restock soon.",
        if(prop("Current Stock") <= (prop("Reorder Level") + 5), 
            "ðŸŸ¡ Moderate Stock. Consider restocking.", 
            "âœ… Stock level is sufficient."
          )
        )
      )  
   ```

## Configuring Zapier Integration
   ### 1. Create a New Zap
   - **Trigger**: "Updated Database Item in Notion"
     - Choose the Notion database you created.
   - **Filter**: "Only Continue If..."
     - Set up the filter to check the "Current Stock" field.
     - Condition: (Number) Less than
     - Value: 1

   ### 2. Action
   - **Send Email via Gmail**:
       - Configure the email action to send a notification to the admin.
       - Customize the email content to include the item details.

## Testing the Automation
   ### 1. Update a Test Item in Notion
   - Set the stock quantity of a test item to zero.
   - Verify that the stock alert message updates correctly.

   ### 2. Test the Zap
   - Manually trigger the Zap in Zapier using the test item.
   - Check the task history to ensure it passed the filter and sent the email.
   - Verify receipt of the email in the admin's inbox.

## Advanced Concepts and Techniques
<!-- ### Webhooks
- **Understanding Webhooks**: Webhooks allow applications to send real-time data to other services. They provide a way for one application to notify another when an event has occurred, making them ideal for scenarios where immediate action is required.
- **Setting Up Webhooks in Zapier**:
  1. **Trigger via Webhook**: Instead of polling for changes at regular intervals, webhooks enable Notion (if supported) or another intermediary service to push data to Zapier instantly when inventory updates occur.
  2. **Webhook Action**: Configure the webhook to send inventory data changes directly to Zapier. Zapier can then process this data and trigger subsequent actions, such as sending an email alert.

### Conditional Logic
- **Understanding Conditional Logic**: Conditional logic allows the creation of dynamic workflows that only proceed when certain conditions are met. This is useful for ensuring actions are only taken when necessary.
- **Implementing Conditional Logic in Zapier**:
  - Use filters to set conditions based on Notion data fields.
  - Combine multiple conditions using logical operators (ONLY IF, AND, OR).

## Concepts
Throughout this project, I developed and refined several key skills and concepts:

- **Database Management in Notion**: The setup and management of dynamic databases, including the use of formulas to generate alerts.
- **Automation with Zapier**: Creating automated workflows to integrate different apps and services seamlessly.
- **Conditional Logic**: Utilizing Zapier's filters and Notion's formulas to create conditional workflows based on specific criteria.
- **Webhooks**: Understanding the role of webhooks in real-time data synchronization and how to implement them for immediate data updates and automation.
- **Testing and Debugging**: Conducted thorough testing and troubleshooting to ensure smooth workflow operations.
- **Real-Time Data Management**: Leveraged webhooks to maintain up-to-date information across systems, ensuring accurate data reflection across platforms.
- **Cross-Application Integration**: Learnt how to efficiently integrate multiple applications (Notion and Gmail) via Zapier, understanding data flows between these platforms, and how to manage these integrations efficiently. -->
